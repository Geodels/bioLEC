    "A python package built to calculate the Landscape elevational connectivity (LEC)\n",

    "_Sample images created with `bioLEC` illustrating the difference in landscape elevational connectivity values with chosen boundary_\n",
    "\n",
    "> **LEC** quantifies the closeness of a site to all others with similar elevation. It measures how easily a species living in a given patch can spread and colonise other patches. It is assumed to be elevation-dependent and the metric depends on how often a species adapted to a given elevation needs to travel outside its optimal elevation range when moving from its patch to any other in the landscape.\n",

    "A documentation regarding **bioLEC** package is available from [readthedoc](http://biolec.readthedocs.io/)\n",

    "There are three notebooks available to demonstrate `bioLEC` capability. \n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need **Python 2.7 or 3.5+**.\n",
    "Also, the following packages are required:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [`numpy`](http://numpy.org)\n",
    " - [`scipy`](https://scipy.org)\n",
    " - [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/)\n",
    " - [`mpi4py`](https://pypi.org/project/mpi4py/)\n",
    " - [`scikit-image`](https://scikit-image.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing using pip\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install `bioLEC` using the\n",
    "[`pip package manager`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) with either version of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python2 -m pip install bioLEC\n",
    "python3 -m pip install bioLEC\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing using Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "A more straightforward installation which does not depend on specific compilers relies on the [docker](http://www.docker.com) virtualisation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the docker image and test it is working:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "   docker pull geodels/biolec:latest\n",
    "   docker run --rm geodels/biolec:latest help\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To build the dockerfile locally, we provide a script. First ensure you have checked out the source code from github and then run the script in the Docker directory. If you modify the dockerfile and want to push the image to make it publicly available, it will need to be retagged to upload somewhere other than the GEodels repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout https://github.com/Geodels/bioLEC.git\n",
    "cd bioLEC\n",
    "source Docker/build-dockerfile.sh\n",
