**bioLEC** documentation is found at [**biolec.readthedocs.io**](https://biolec.readthedocs.io/)

**bioLEC** is a parallel python package built to calculate the *Landscape elevational connectivity* (**LEC**).

![bioLEC](https://github.com/Geodels/bioLEC/blob/master/Notebooks/images/intro.jpg?raw=true)


**LEC** quantifies the closeness of a site to all others with **similar elevation**. It measures how easily a **species living in a given patch can spread and colonise other patches**. It is assumed to be **elevation-dependent** and the metric depends on how often a species adapted to a given elevation *needs to travel outside its optimal elevation range* when moving from its patch to any other in the landscape [Bertuzzo et al., 2016].

## Installation

### Dependencies

You will need **Python 2.7 or 3.5+**.
Also, the following packages are required:

 - [`numpy`](http://numpy.org)
 - [`scipy`](https://scipy.org)
 - [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
 - [`mpi4py`](https://pypi.org/project/mpi4py/)
 - [`scikit-image`](https://scikit-image.org/)
 - [`rasterio`](https://pypi.org/project/rasterio/)

### Installing using pip

You can install `bioLEC` using the
[`pip package manager`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) with either version of Python:

```bash
python2 -m pip install bioLEC
python3 -m pip install bioLEC
```

### Installing using Docker

A more straightforward installation which does not depend on specific compilers relies on the [docker](http://www.docker.com) virtualisation system.

To install the docker image and test it is working:

```bash
   docker pull geodels/biolec:latest
   docker run --rm geodels/biolec:latest help
```

To build the dockerfile locally, we provide a script. First ensure you have checked out the source code from github and then run the script in the Docker directory. If you modify the dockerfile and want to push the image to make it publicly available, it will need to be retagged to upload somewhere other than the GEodels repository.

```bash
git checkout https://github.com/Geodels/bioLEC.git
cd bioLEC
source Docker/build-dockerfile.sh
```

## Usage

### Binder & docker container

Launch the demonstration at [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Geodels/bioLEC/binder?filepath=Notebooks)

  > _Notebooks environment_ will not be the best option for _large landscape models_ and we will recommend the use of the python script: `runLEC.py` in HPC environment. the code will need to be

```bash
mpirun -np 400 python runLEC.py
```

Or using the Docker container available through Kitematic **geodels/biolec**.

## Collaborations

### How to contribute?

**We welcome all kinds of contributions!** Please get in touch if you would like to help out.

 > Everything from **code** to **notebooks** to **examples** and **documentation** are all equally valuable so please don't feel you can't contribute.

To contribute please **fork the project make your changes and submit a pull request**. We will do our best to work through any issues with you and get your code merged into the main branch.

If you found a bug, have questions, or are just having trouble with **bioLEC**, you can:

+ join the **bioLEC User Group on Slack** by sending an email request to: tristan.salles@sydney.edu.au
+ open an issue in our [issue-tracker](https://github.com/Geodels/bioLEC/issues/new) and we'll try to help resolve the concern.

### Where to find support?

Please feel free to submit new issues to the [issue-log](https://github.com/Geodels/bioLEC/issues/new) to request new features, document new bugs, or ask questions.
