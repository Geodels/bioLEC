What is LEC?
============

**LEC** quantifies the closeness of a site to all others with **similar elevation**.
For a given landscape, LEC is primarily dependent on **elevation range and on species niche width**. It quantifies the closeness of any point in the landscape to all others at similar elevation.

It has been shown that LEC captures well the :math:`\alpha`-**diversity variations** observed in mountainous landscape [Lomolino2008]_ and simulated by full **meta-community models** [Bertuzzo2016]_.

.. important::
  It suggests that **geomorphic features are a first-order control on biodiversity** and that **LEC metric can be used to  quickly assess species richness distribution in complex landscapes**.


Computing cost
--------------

Considering a 2D lattice made of *N* squared cells, LEC for cell *i* (:math:`\mathrm{LEC}_i`) is given by

.. math::
   \mathrm{LEC}_i = \sum_{j=1}^N C_{ji}

where :math:`C_{ji}` quantifies the closeness between sites *j* and *i* with respect to elevational connectivity. :math:`C_{ji}` measures the cost for a given species adapted to cell *j* to spread and colonise cell *i*. This cost is a function of elevation and evaluates how often species adapted to the elevation of cell *j* have to travel outside their optimal species niche width (:math:`\sigma`) to reach cell *i* (as shown in the figure below).

Following Bertuzzo et al. [Bertuzzo2016]_, :math:`C_{ji}` is expressed as:

.. math::
   -\ln C_{ji} = \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \min_{p  \in \{j\rightarrow i\}} \sum_{r=2}^L (z_{k_r}-z_j)^2

where :math:`p=[k_1,k_2, ...,k_L]` (with :math:`k_1=j` and :math:`k_L=i`) are the cells comprised in the path *p* from *j* to *i*.

In the figure above, we illustrate the approach implemented in **bioLEC** to compute the closeness measure (:math:`C_{ji}`) used to quantify **LEC** based on a topography grid. Two paths from site *j* to *i* (inset) are proposed with their elevation profiles. Associated costs are computed following the equation above (:math:`\sum_{r=2}^L (z_{k_r}-z_j)^2`).


.. hint::
    Despite a longer length, **the cost associated to the red path is smaller than that of the blue one** as it passes across sites with similar elevations to :math:`z_j` (adapted from Bertuzzo et al. [Bertuzzo2016]_)

The estimation of :math:`C_{ji}` requires computation of all the possible paths *p* from *j* to *i* and is defined as the maximum closeness value along these paths.


Dijkstra's algorithm
--------------------

The above equation is solved for each cell *j* using **Dijkstra's algorithm** [Dijkstra1959]_ with diagonal connectivity between cells. For each cell *j*, the algorithm  builds a **Dijkstra tree** that branches the given cell with all the cells defining the simulated region. Edge weights are set equal to the square of the difference between the considered vertex elevation (:math:`z_{k_r}`) and :math:`z_j`. The least-cost distance between *j* and *i* is then calculated as the minimum sum of edge weights obtained from the cells along the shortest-path (see top figure).

Here, the closeness is measured as a least-cost distances that optimises the costs associated to the edge weights of the traversed cells as well as the travelled Euclidean distance. As the least-cost distances incorporate landscape costs to movement, the approach allows for closeness differentiation between cells that might be seen as equally near if landscape costs were not accounted for.

Parallelisation
---------------

Calculation of LEC values over the entire simulated region (:math:`\sim` 1 M points) is slow. Here we adopt a simple parallel strategy where Dijkstra trees for all paths are balanced and distributed over multiple processors using message passing interface (**MPI**). Using this approach, LEC computation for any given time step is less than 4 minutes when distributed over 240 processors.
