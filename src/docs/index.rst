bioLEC - *Landscape elevational connectivity*
=============================================

Overview
========

**bioLEC** is a parallel python package built to calculate the *Landscape elevational connectivity* (**LEC**).
**LEC** quantifies the closeness of a site to all others with similar elevation.

For a given landscape, LEC is primarily dependent on the elevation field and on species niche width.
It quantifies the closeness of any point in the landscape to all others at similar elevation.
