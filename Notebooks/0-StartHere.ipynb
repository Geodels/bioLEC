    "# Stripy\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python interface to TRIPACK and STRIPACK Fortran code for (constrained) triangulation in Cartesian coordinates and on a sphere. Stripy is an object-oriented package and includes routines from SRFPACK and SSRFPACK for interpolation (nearest neighbor, linear and hermite cubic) and to evaluate derivatives (Renka 1996a,b and 1997a,b).\n",
    "\n",
    "`stripy` is bundled with `litho1pt0` which is a python interface to the _crust 1.0_ dataset and the lithospheric part of the _litho 1.0_ dataset (Laske et al, 2013 and Pasyanos et al, 2014) which both requires and demonstrates the triangulation / searching and interpolation on the sphere that is provided by `stripy`.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two matching sets of `stripy` notebooks - one set for [Cartesian Triangulations](#Cartesian) and one for [Spherical Triangulations](#Spherical). For most geographical applications, the spherical triangulations are the natural choice as they expect longitude and latitude coordinates (admittedly in radians).\n",

    "\n",
    "To install ([numpy](http://numpy.org) and fortran compiler, preferably\n",
    "[gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran), required):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python setup.py build\n",
    "```\n",
    "   - If you change the fortran compiler, you may have to add the\n",
    "flags `config_fc --fcompiler=<compiler name>` when setup.py is run\n",
    "(see docs for [numpy.distutils](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/f2py/distutils.html)).\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python setup.py install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively install using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install [--user] stripy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Two classes are included as part of the Stripy package:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sTriangulation (Spherical coordinates)\n",
    "- Triangulation (Cartesian coordinates)\n",
    "\n",
    "These classes share similar methods and can be easily interchanged.\n",
    "In addition, there are many helper functions provided for building\n",
    "\n",
    "A series of tests are located in the *tests* subdirectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Docker \n",
    "\n",
    "A more straightforward installation which does not depend on specific compilers relies on the [docker](http://www.docker.com) virtualisation system. \n",
    "\n",
    "To install the docker image and test it is working: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "   docker pull lmoresi/stripy:0.6\n",
    "   docker run --rm lmoresi/stripy:0.6 help\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the helper scripts for bash:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "   docker run --rm lmoresi/stripy:0.6 bash_utils > bash_utils.sh\n",
    "   source bash_utils.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "( you may find it helpful to move/rename this file and source it from\n",
    "  your bash profile at login time )\n",
    "\n",
    "The bash_utils.sh script installs the following functions which are \n",
    "available through the bash command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "  stripy-docker-help\n",
    "  stripy-docker-sh\n",
    "  stripy-docker-nb\n",
    "  stripy-docker-browse\n",
    "  stripy-docker-serve\n",
    "  stripy-docker-terminal\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on these functions, run\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "  source bash_utils.sh\n",
    "  stripy-docker-help\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the docker version as you would, say, using ipython to type on the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "   source bash_utils.sh  # (only needs to be done once)\n",
    "   stripy-docker-terminal\n",
    "   ls \n",
    "   ipython\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the docker version to run a script\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "   source bash_utils.sh  # (only needs to be done once)\n",
